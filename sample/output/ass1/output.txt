=== test 1: ass1  < test4.txt
=== Output: differs from expectations
 |    STAGE ONE: This test data mostly just contains
 |    text and whitespace, and no formatting commands.
 |    Students who generate the right output for this
 |    test file have a program that meets the Stage 1
 |    (or better) expectations. The .p command indicates
 |    a new paragraph, but only when the full-stop is in
 |    column one, and only for a Stage Two program, and
 |    that ".p" wasn't in column one, so a ".p" should
 |    appear in the output. Cool, yes?!

=== test 2: ass1  < test5.txt
=== Output: differs from expectations
 |    STAGE TWO TEST.
 |
 |    Ok, so this test file contains some Stage Two
 |    commands. In Stage Two, students need to be able
 |    to deal with all of:
 |    .b;
 |    .p;
 |    .l nn; and
 |    .w nn.
 |
 |    Repeated ".p" commands should result in a single
 |    new paragraph occurring; and the default left
 |    margin of 4 and the default width of 50 should be
 |    in operation, here is a ruler to help you check on
 |    that:
 |    1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40---45---50
 |
-|
 |  And repeated ".l" commands (like there just were
 |  in the input text) should result in a new left
 |  margin equal to the last of the values entered,
 |  without multiple paragraph breaks getting
 |  generated; this paragraph should have a
 |  two-character left margin, and still have a width
 |  of 50 characters, here is the ruler again:
 |  1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40---45---50
 |
-|
 |  Finally, if ".w" is used, the line width
 |  gets altered; this line should be in a
 |  paragraph with a width of 40 characters.
 |  So, to recap: at this point we should
 |  have a left margin of two characters,
 |  and up to 40 characters per line used by
 |  the text. Care to count, anyone? Here is
 |  a ruler to make use of...
 |  1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
 |
-|
 |  And now, after another
 |  paragraph break, the lines
 |  should be thirty characters
 |  long, here is another ruler to
 |  let you check.
-|
 |  1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
 |  That ruler was preceded by a
 |  ".b" command, but there
 |  shouldn't be a blank line in
 |  front of it, even though it is
 |  a long token that exceeds the
 |  current line width.
 |
 |  Ok, that's enough. Good luck
 |  with dealing with all of that
 |  Stage Two output. And hey, PS,
 |  note that there are no Stage
 |  Three commands in this test,
 |  so Stage Two and Stage Three
 |  programs will generate the
 |  same output.
 |
 |  (But a Stage One program will
 |  have just given one very long
 |  paragraph for this input
 |  file.)

 |                    The Grumpy Lecturer

 |          ----------------------------------------
 |          1 Testing The .h Command
 |
 |          Ok, so that was a level one heading.
 |
 |          1.1 The .h command (again)
 |
 |          And that was a level two heading.
 |
 |          1.2 The .h command (a third time)
 |
-|
 |          1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
 |          And that was a second level two heading,
 |          it's all a bit boring really.
 |
 |          1.2.1 A third level heading
 |
 |          1.2.1.0.1 And straight away a fifth level heading
 |
 |          1.2.1.1 Followed by a fourth level heading
 |
 |          1.2.1.1.1 And then another fifth level heading
 |
 |          It is all not just a bit boring, but
 |          actually really really boring -- this
 |          text should be in paragraph number
 |          1.2.1.1.1, if I have counted correctly.
 |          And the lines should be not more than 40
 |          characters long.
 |          1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40

 |          2 The Last .h Command
 |
 |          What else to say? It's hard creating
 |          these files of meaningless test data. It
 |          just gets so challenging to be creative.
 |
 |                      But Not Always!
 |
 |          ----------------------------------------
 |          3 The End of the Testing
 |
 |          This test file doesn't change the left
 |          margin or the width, except at the
 |          beginning, before any of the output is
 |          generated (except that first overall
 |          ruler). It just explores the heading and
 |          centering commands that were a required
 |          part of a Stage Three program, using a
 |          .l left margin of 10 and a .w width of
 |          40.
 |
 |                 Maybe your program worked!
